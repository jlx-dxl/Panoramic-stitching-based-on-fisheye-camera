# Panoramic stitching based on fisheye camera
 Use three fisheye cameras to realize 360-degree panoramic camera, project design camera calibration, feature point recognition, feature point matching, image stitching, etc. It is worth noting that the de-distorted image is not suitable for wide-angle panoramic stitching, and the longitude and latitude expansion of the fisheye camera is required.
